# [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-vowels-in-a-substring-of-given-length/description/)

# Intuition
The problem seems to ask for the maximum number of vowels in any substring of length k in a given string s. The idea is to maintain a "sliding window" of length k and count the number of vowels in that window.

# Approach
1. I initialized a set vowels to quickly identify vowel characters.
2. Then I counted the number of vowels in the initial substring of length k.
3. I used a variable count to keep track of the number of vowels in the current window and initialize it based on the first k characters of s.
4. answer is initialized to count to store the maximum number of vowels I found in any substring of length k.
5. Then, for each subsequent character in s, I adjusted count by adding the new character's contribution and subtracting the contribution of the character that got removed from the window. I also update danswer to be the maximum of answer and count.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n), where n is the length of the string s. We go through the string once, making constant time updates.
- Space complexity:
O(1), as we are using only a constant amount (k) of extra space (the set of vowels and a few integer variables).

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxVowels(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        vowels = {'a','e','i','o','u'}  # O(1)
        count = 0  # O(1)
        
        # Initialize the count for the first window
        for i in range(k):  # O(k)
            count += int(s[i] in vowels)  # O(1)
        
        answer = count  # O(1)
        
        # Slide the window
        for i in range(k, len(s)):  # O(n-k)
            count += int(s[i] in vowels)  # O(1)
            count -= int(s[i - k] in vowels)  # O(1)
            answer = max(answer, count)  # O(1)
        return answer  # O(1)
